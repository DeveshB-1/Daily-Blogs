### Today's Study Session: LR and Percentages

A productive day focusing on two key areas: Logical Reasoning (LR) and Percentages.

While brief, consistent study is crucial for long-term retention and mastery. Today's session aimed to reinforce existing knowledge and identify areas for further exploration.

**Logical Reasoning (LR):**

*   I dedicated time to reviewing core LR concepts. I didn't dive into anything specific, but I feel it's always good to keep the fundamentals sharp.

**Percentages:**

*   Revised various percentage-related calculations. This included:
    *   Calculating percentages of numbers.
    *   Finding percentage increases and decreases.
    *   Working with percentage word problems.

**Next Steps:**

Moving forward, I plan to:

*   Focus on more advanced Logical Reasoning question types.
*   Explore more complex percentage problems involving multiple steps and variables.
*   Implement practice tests to gauge my progress.

Overall, today was a solid day of review. Consistency is key!
